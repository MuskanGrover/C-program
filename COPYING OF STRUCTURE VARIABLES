/*
Assigning a structure variable to another structure variable in two ways.
a) copying all elements in one go by assigning an already created structure 
   variable to a new structure variable.
   Remember: both the variables must be of the same structure type(tags must be same).
b) piece-meal copying ,i.e. assigning members of an already created structure 
   variable the corresponding members of a new structure variable.
